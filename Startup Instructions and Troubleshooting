Startup Instructions

1. Turn on promisc mode
	ip link set ens192 promisc on
2. Restart ES
	systemctl restart elasticsearch
	give it a minute or two before checking the web interface but this should work
3. Fix "Kibana server not ready"
	curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/.kibana*
4. Start Zeek
	./opt/zeek/bin/zeekctl
	start
5. Check services. You will probably have to restart all of these
	systemctl status elasticsearch
	systemctl status kibana
	systemctl status logstash
	systemctl status filebeat
	
Troubleshooting
How did you get past the "not saving index" problem?
I think I just restarted the server and restarted all the services

Create a space from a command
curl -X POST http://localhost:9200/api/spaces/space -H 'kbn-xsrf: true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"id": "default","name": "Default"}'
Restart elasticsearch and kibana

Check your filebeat config
filebeat -c /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml -e

If you're adding paths to filebeat you have to restart the filebeat service after adding the path and field

If you're adding fields in Logstash you probably have to refresh the indexes

Check logstash config
/usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash --config.test_and_exit --path.settings /etc/logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/01-BeatsConfig.conf

Delete all Kibana indexes
curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/*
